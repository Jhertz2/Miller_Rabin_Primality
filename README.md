# Miller_Rabin_Primality

This project consists of 3 functions: mod_exp, gen_rand_10, and Miller_Rabin.

mod_exp performs modular exponentiation. This will be later implemented in the Miller Rabin Primality Test.

gen_rand_10 is a function which generates 10 random, 10 digit prime numbers. It does this by using the Miller_Rabin function to test for primality and changing the randomly generated number until it is prime. 

Miller_Rabin employs the Miller Rabin Primality test to determine the primality of any number, no matter how large!
